1. There are 4 key current develop directions:
	- Secure/Reliable/Safe
	- Energy-Efficient (AI training is destorying our environment!)
	- Low-Latency & Predictable (these are different)
	- Usage like AI, Genomics, Medicine, ...
2. Basically, we will learn how computers work from the ground up
3. From logic gates, we can build logic circuits:
	1. A logic circuit is composed of:
		- Inputs
		- Outputs
		- Functional specification: defines the logical operation the circuit should perform
		- Timing specification: specifies the propagation delay, which is the time for outputs to respond to changes in inputs
	2. Types of logic circults
		- Combinational logic: memoryless, system reacts instantly.
		- Sequential logic: outputs are determined by both historical and current values of inputs
4. In today's computer, we orchestrating electrons for computing, and here below is the transformation hierarchy:

5. Computer Architecture
	- is the science and art of designing computing platforms (hardware, interface, system SW , and programming model)
	- to achieve a set of design goals (like the highest performance on earth or the longest battery life)
	- From a supercomputer to your smartphone, many fundamental principles are similar
